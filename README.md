# sg &mdash; styleguide sourcegate [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/orlin/sg.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/orlin/sg)

My little stylegiuide is like a stargate for stellar code linting.

Styleguides are [not uncommon](https://github.com/styleguide).
It's a good idea to have one, at least.
Even better if one could lint with one or more of these.

It's all great, and even better, I've moved on to lint with the
[hal-rc](https://github.com/orlin/hal-rc) /
[beverage](https://github.com/orlin/beverage) configuration tools.

Check them out if you use any `js` or `coffee` linters or hinters.
They supersede and obsolete this.
